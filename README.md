# gimp-stable-diffusion

This repository offers a GIMP plugin that generates images with
stable-diffusion:

## StableHorde

The plugin uses [StableHorde](https://stablehorde.net) as its backend.
StableHorde is a cluster of stable-diffusion servers run by volunteers.

[Download the plugin for Gimp-3](https://github.com/ikks/gimp-stable-diffusion/blob/main/stablehorde-gimp3/gimp-stable-diffusion.py).

Head to [Gimp3 instructions](/stablehorde-gimp3/README.md) or [Gimp2.10.X
instructions](/stablehorde/README.md).

You can join [Discord](https://discord.gg/3DxrhksKzn), to find someone to
help you using StableHorde or the plugin itself.  Have fun with your prompts
and the results from thousands of years of experiences and thoughts.
